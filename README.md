This repository contains the space datasets for the article "A space non-cooperative target recognition method for multi-satellite cooperative capture systems".

In the paper，a space target dataset and a space scene dataset are constructed, containing 15 types of satellites and 39 types of debris.    
The space target dataset is designed for the training of the classification network.  
The space scene dataset is suitable for satellite and debris multi-target detection tasks.
